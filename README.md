# scraping_test

Status:

MySQL test done

Ruby task#1 30% done. release and article parameter not getting with scrape.

Ruby task#2 spent less time on it, so some part of it roughly done. All PDFs contains required attributes at random positions so they are not coming with common logic.

For Ruby task#1, there is a tip: this website has some open API.
I have checked these API's https://api.nasa.gov/, there are no such API's endpoints related with press-articles.
